Rubex

by Zhigang Chen

A simple regular expression library that can support various regular expression syntaxes used by popular programming languages or tools, like Ruby, Java, Perl, grep, and emacs. It implements all the public functions of Go's Regexp package, except LiteralPrefix. QuoteMeta function is copied from the Regexp package just to avoid referencing/linking the entire Regexp. It supports the Ruby regex syntax. Other languages' regex syntax can be supported.



The library calls the Oniguruma regex library (5.9.2, the latest release as of now) for regex pattern searching. All replacement code is done in Go.

I patched Oniguruma so that pkg-config can see it and therefore Cgo can get the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS. It is included as a git submodule. After you clone rubex, do "git submodule init; git submodule update". That should pull the patched oniguruma source.

Then you run

   make onig

At the last step, you are asked to input your sudo password to install the library to proper paths.

Or, if you want to install it yourself, on Mac and using Home Brew, you can install it by the formula here, https://github.com/zhigangc/brew_formulas/blob/master/oniguruma.rb. Otherwise, you can clone the source and build it from her, https://github.com/zhigangc/oniguruma.

Also it uses a build tool called "gb", available at "http://code.google.com/p/go-gb/".

So, to build the project, just go to the root directory and type

   gb -bm

To install the package

   gb -i

To run tests

   gb -t

To clean up 

   gb -cm

To run benchmarks

   gotest -test.bench="."
